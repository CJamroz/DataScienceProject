## **Intro to Data Science Project: Bike Share Data**
In this project, I hope to be able to predict bike share usage during on a given day.
I will be using the Bike Sharing Data Set for Capital Bikeshare from the UCI Machine Repository.
The data in this file gives the number of bike rentals for registered and non-registered customers for dates during 2011-2012.  The dataset includes the temperature, air temperature, humidity, windspeed, and whether it was a working-day or weekend.
I think it will be interesting to see if these variables are related to the number of bikes rented at any given time of day in a particular season.
